# Cron Jobs Explained

## Overview of Cron Jobs
  
Cron is a time-based job scheduler in Unix-like operating systems. Users can schedule jobs (commands or scripts) to run periodically at fixed times, dates, or intervals. Cron is driven by a configuration file called crontab (cron table), which specifies shell commands to run periodically on a given schedule.

## How Cron Jobs Work

- Crontab File: Each user has their own crontab file where they can define cron jobs. The system also has a global crontab file for system-wide tasks.

- Crontab Syntax: Each line in the crontab file represents a cron job and follows this syntax:
    
    ```bash
    * * * * *  cmd_to_execute (shell cmd or script path)
    - - -
    - - - - -
    | | | | |
    | | | | +---- Day of wk.(0-7) (0 or 7 is Sun, or use names)
    | | | |                 
    | | | +------ Month (1 - 12)
    | | +-------- Day of month (1 - 31)
    | +---------- Hr. (0 - 23)
    +------------ Minute (0 - 59) 

    M H D M DOW command
    ```

- The `minute`, `hour`, `day`, `month`, and `day_of_week` fields specify when the command should run. The values can be numbers, ranges, lists, or asterisks.
- Numbers represent specific values, such as `0` for midnight or `5` for 5 AM.
- Ranges are specified with a hyphen (-), such as `1-5` for the first five hours.
- Lists are specified with commas (,), such as `1,3,5` for the first, third, and fifth hours.
- The `command` field contains the shell command or script to execute.
- The crontab file can be edited using the `crontab -e` command.
 
- Common Scheduling Examples:
  - Example: `* * * * * /path/to/script.sh` runs the script every minute.
  - Example: `5 * * * * /path/to/script.sh` runs the script at the 5th minute of every hour.
  - Example: `*/5 * * * * /path/to/script.sh` runs the script every 5 minutes.
  - Example: `0 20 * * 1-5 /path/to/script.sh` runs the script at 8 PM from Monday to Friday.
  - Example: `0 0 * * 0 /path/to/script.sh` runs the script at midnight on Sundays.
  - Example: `0 0 1 * * /path/to/script.sh` runs the script at midnight on the first day of every month.
  - Example: `0 0 1 1 * /path/to/script.sh` runs the script at midnight on January 1st.

## Listing Crontab: 

To list the current cron jobs, use:
    
```bash
crontab -l
```

## Editing Crontab:

To edit the crontab file, use:

```bash
crontab -e
```

## Removing Crontab:

To remove all cron jobs, use:

```bash
crontab -r
```

## System Crontab vs. User Crontab:
  - System Crontab: The system-wide crontab file is usually located in `/etc/crontab` or `/etc/cron.d/` and is used for system-wide tasks.
  - User Crontab: Each user has their own crontab file, typically located in `/var/spool/cron/crontabs/` or `/var/spool/cron/`.
  - Cron Logs: Cron jobs generate logs that can be viewed in `/var/log/syslog` or `/var/log/cron.log` depending on the system configuration.
