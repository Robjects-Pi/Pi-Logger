## Recommended Order of Execution

To properly set up and manage the Pi-Logger service on your Raspberry Pi, follow these steps in order:

1. [Setup Systemd Service](1.0_setup_systemd_service/create-service-file.md): Create the systemd service file and configure it to run the Pi-Logger service.
2. [Managing Service with Systemctl](2.0_managing_service_with_systemctl/managing_systemd_service.md): Learn how to manage the Pi-Logger service using systemctl commands.
3. [Check pi-logger log_entries.csv](2.0_managing_service_with_systemctl/check_pi-logger_log_entries.md): Learn how to check the log_entries.csv file generated by the Pi-Logger service. This is already a completed task as extra systemd logs is not needed.
4. [Logging with Systemd](3.0_Logging_with_systemd/logging_with_systemd.md) (Optional): Explore advanced logging options for the Pi-Logger service using systemd journal.
5. [View Service Logs](3.0_Logging_with_systemd/view_service_logs.md) (Optional): Learn how to view the logs generated by the Pi-Logger service using systemd journal.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and modify files in the `/etc/systemd/system/` directory.
- After making any changes to the service file, remember to reload the systemd daemon using `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`.
- If you encounter any issues, check the service logs using `sudo journalctl -u pi-logger.service`.

By following these guides in order, you'll have a fully functional Pi-Logger service running on your Raspberry Pi, managed by systemd. This setup ensures that the logger runs automatically at system boot and provides a robust and reliable logging solution for your Raspberry Pi projects.
